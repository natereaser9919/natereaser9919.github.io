<P>Over the past few years I have built up some work experience as well as held leadership positions.Ive worked several
    different jobs ech one giving me a good understanding of business structure and management. </P>

<H2>Tom Thumb</H2>

<P>I worked at a grocery store called Tom Thumb from the end of my sophomore year of high school to the beginning of my
senior year. I started as a bag boy, eventually working my way up to the checker position. After several months of being
a checker I was asked to move to a higher paying position as a meat department clerk, where I learned the basics of being
butcher.Each job taught me skills, such as customer service as well as allowing me to get my hands on some information
systems used for each job.</P>

well as Governmental procedures. As a lodge employee I was in charge of gun sales, which meant I had to learn the procedures
behind gun sales.As well as dealing with a lot of different customers giving me even more customer service experience. I
plan on continuing to work there this summer and might transfer to the Bangor store next year.</P>
