<H2>Fishing</H2>
<P>One of my favorite things to do after a long day is heading to the local pond to try and catch some massive Bass.
This summer was no exception, I went fishing almost every day as soon as I got off work. And because I moved up to
Massachusates I got into Stripped Bass fishing, me and my buddy took a charter off the cape and caught tons of fish.
I am also joining the Umaine fishing club this year to continue one of my favorite hobbies.</P>
